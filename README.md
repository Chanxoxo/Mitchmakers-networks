Spell 'Splosion
===============

Overview
--------
An example project to show a few ways of recreating mechanics from the 2D Worms games. This includes everything needed to follow along with a youtube video I haven't made yet.

All code is written in GDScript, and hopefully documented well-enough to understand. The youtube video will walk through some of the project setup that's a bit unintuitive.


Art Assets
----------
The Assets/Explosions folder contains images from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/), specifically from [Game Assets #1](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets-1)

I created the other assets for this project. The Aseprite source files are included in the Assets folder. Feel free to use these however you want in your own projects. \
If you don't have Aseprite you can purchase it from [their website](https://www.aseprite.org/) or compile it yourself (for free) from its [source on GitHub](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite)
