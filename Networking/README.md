# Networking
Godot 4 is changing up the networking structure of projects, and adding some handy new nodes.

I'm trialling them, and putting the resulting projects here.

> Note: These require an Alpha (or newer) build of Godot 4. Being on the bleeding edge is painful, and if you're working on a serious project you probably want to stick with 3.X - in which case these experiments will not be useful to you.

## [Basic](https://github.com/MitchReidNZ/Godot-Things/tree/main/Networking/Basic)
This is the most straightforward example, showing off the new MultiplayerSpawner and MultiplayerSynchronizer nodes. It only has a few lines of networking code, and no custom assets.
