# (Slightly) More advanced networking
Trialling something a little more advanced using the new Godot 4 networking features.

> Note: These require an Alpha (or newer) build of Godot 4. Being on the bleeding edge is painful, and if you're working on a serious project you probably want to stick with 3.X - in which case these experiments will not be useful to you.

## WIP
This project is still WIP, and there's no breakdown tutorial yet. Feel free to poke around though!

## Running
Edit the batch files in this folder, replacing the exe with the path to your godot executable.

If you'd like to see the server-eye view, remove the `--headless` argument from the server batch file.
